1) Many commenters said they were "blown away," so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office.
I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving.
But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!?
There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects.
That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre.

2) We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight.
We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates
with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time
I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie,
it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work.
