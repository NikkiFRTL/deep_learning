I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving.
But, fellow movie viewers and especially great film lovers really?

We have ve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight.
We have seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates

I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie,
it is the acting that makes it a great piece of work.
